                    <h2>ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION</h2>
                    <p>
                        The DLSU Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu & Grappling Organization (DLSU BJJ GO) is the first BJJ and Grappling organization established in DLSU. It is likewise the first and the only one of its kind in the country. It offers quality instruction and resources related to the art/sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and related grappling disciplines. The college organization was founded by the first Filipino homegrown BJJ blackbelt who is also an alumnus of DLSU - Sensei Arthur Alvin A. Aguilar,. He is also the founding father of Mixed Martial Arts in the country. 

Fast-forward to 2020, another milestone was achieved when the DLSU BJJ GO was founded at the Senior High School level (DLSU-SHS) in Manila by one of its students, who is now an undergraduate student of the university - Joaquin Antonio C. Marte.

Both organizations are under the umbrella of Deftac Philippines - the largest and most successful BJJ academy in the Philippines and Asia. The organization is also affiliated with one of the most respected and world renown international BJJ academies - Six Blades Jiu-Jitsu International Association, headed by multiple world champion and International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation's (IBJJF) Hall of Famer, Sensei Alexandre 'Xande' Ribeiro.
 
The organization offers self-defense techniques involving ground combat, without the need for striking (e.g., punching, kicking, etc.). Instead, the art/sport advocates non-lethal means to subdue or control an opponent using leverage, joint locks, chokeholds, and strategy over brute strength, making BJJ an effective self-defense system for practitioners of all ages and sizes.

The core philosophy of the sport revolves around the idea that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a larger, stronger opponent by using proper technique. In addition to self-defense, BJJ is also widely practiced as a sport. There are also mental and psychological benefits derived from practicing the art/sport.

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The DLSU BJJ GO aims to promote awareness and teach self-defense amongst members of the Lasallian undergraduate school community through the art/sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Grappling. It also aims to train aspiring individuals, and hopefully produce future renowned sporting and martial arts figures, or representatives in local and international sporting events. The Organization hopes to instill the “Six Blades Mentality” through the values of:

●Family - by satisfying the need for belongingness, exemplifying family-oriented values, and promoting camaraderie among members through sports and socially-relevant activities;
● Loyalty - to one’s team, school, country, and faith;
● Discipline - by imbibing and imparting the knowledge and values of the art/sport;;
● Attitude - towards professional growth, and the pursuit of academic and sports excellence;
● Honor - for his/her own, team, school, and country; and
● Respect - towards others and oneself.

The Organization also strives to produce life-long learners, whose strengths and acquired skill sets stem from his/her/their own self-motivation and acquired passion for the art/sport.

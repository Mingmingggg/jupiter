            <p>
               
                DLSU Prism, the premier LGBTQ+ organization of the De La Salle University, welcomes the
                proponents and allies of the marginalized and those who are subject to discrimination because of gender identity. We passionately believe in the importance of educating the Lasallian Community on the wide spectrum of gender and sexuality, including those who do not conform to the binary standards of society. Part of the organization&#39;s mantle of duties is to have an active contribution to the ongoing struggle for equal rights of the LGBTQ+ Community, whereas our collective efforts goes beyond the vicinity of the university and to a wider range of influence. We firmly believe that the welfare of each and every member of the LGBTQ+ Community is to be addressed in high priority, to which we commit ourselves to the aid of the marginalized, united by the Lasallian core values of Faith, Service, and Community.

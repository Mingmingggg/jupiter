            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The DLSU Physics Society is a haven for Physics enthusiasts. Here, the members can discuss Physics topics that are interesting to them and engage in a fruitful dialogue. Physics talks are also implemented in this organization, where professors share useful and imaginative insights on having a job and career in Physics. We also conduct activities like campus tours to different Science Institutions in the Philippines.

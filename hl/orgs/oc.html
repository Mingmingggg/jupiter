            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
                The DLSU Outdoor Club has primarily been organized to give outdoor enthusiasts an opportunity to discover themselves and their environment through communication with nature. The club believes that nature exists for the benefit of all living creatures, wherein the existence of each one complements the other, and for outdoor activities to become a widespread and popular interest among many. These outdoor enthusiasts should observe proper ethics, promote and practice wise environmental decisions, and support environmental programs. They should also be aware of important issues which include pollution management, recycling, proper waste management, reforestation, animal protection, and nature protection.

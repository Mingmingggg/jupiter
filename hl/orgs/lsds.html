                    <p>
                        "Founded in 1922 as the La Salle Forensics Team, the La Salle Debate Society is one of the oldest and most reputable debating institutions in the world. It has hosted and participated in numerous national and international tournaments, continuously achieving and acquiring awards for the university and the Society. It aims to foster growth among its members, raising them with the philosophy of what it means to win with honor and to make the game beautiful. It envisions a world where everyone can engage in intellectual discourse and gives them a platform to speak up.

La Salle Debate Society has two main flagship events each year, the Lasallian Interschool Training, a debate workshop and seminar for high school students, and the National Asians High School Debate Championship, the country's national Asian Parliamentary debate tournament for high school students.

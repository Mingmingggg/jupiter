                    <p>
                        Now in its 73rd year, the Chemical Engineering Society (ChEn) remains dedicated to
                        nurturing and propelling the academic growth of outstanding chemical engineering students at DLSU. As the official student organization of the DLSU Department of Chemical Engineering, our mission extends beyond academic excellence. We are committed to broadening our members'
                        perspectives and unleashing their potential through a range of events and activities tailored to their areas of expertise.
                        
                        Presently, DLSU's Chemical Engineering program holds ABET accreditation, signifying its
                        alignment with international standards in Applied and Natural Science, Computer, Engineering,
                        and Engineering Technology education. Additionally, the Commission on Higher Education
                        (CHED) has designated the DLSU Chemical Engineering program as a Center of Excellence
                        within the university.

                      <p>In this year's Hunger Games-themed Sportsfest, teams from both CSO and non-CSO organizations will battle across three thrilling arenas: 
                        basketball, volleyball, and dodgeball. Much like tributes in the Capitol’s arena, players must rely on teamwork, strategy, and quick 
                        reflexes to survive and claim victory. The basketball tournament will test coordination and endurance, volleyball will challenge agility 
                        and precision, and dodgeball will demand sharp instincts and tactical plays. Competing in single-elimination formats, only the strongest
                         and most unified teams will rise to the top, securing the title of champions in this year’s Tribute Sports Showdown!.</p>

                         from both CSO and non-CSO organizations to compete for glory. Divided into five clusters with two teams per cluster,
                          a total of 10 teams will face off in a high-stakes, single-elimination format. Much like tributes in the arena,
                           teams must use strategy, teamwork, and skill to outlast their opponents and bring honor to their organization. 
                           Only one team will rise victorious, securing the title as the champions of this year's Tribute Hoops Showdown!</p>

                        Sportsfest, invites both CSO and non-CSO organizations from DLSU Manila to battle for supremacy in this year’s 
                        Tribute Spike Off. Much like the tributes in the arena, teams will rely on strategy, agility, and coordination 
                        to outlast their rivals in a single-elimination format. Ten teams from various organization clusters will compete, 
                        forming alliances and using their collective strength to fight for the coveted championship title. Only one team 
                        will rise as victor, claiming glory in the spirit of the Games.</p>

                  <div class="tribute-box">
                      <p>In this Hunger Games-themed dodgeball contest, teams must eliminate all opponents by hitting them with a ball 
                        or catching their throws before the ball touches the ground, just as tributes outlast their rivals in the arena. 
                        Success depends on quick reflexes, strategy, and teamwork, with each dodge, throw, and catch mirroring the survival 
                        tactics seen in the Capitol’s games. Victory hinges on a well-balanced 
                        approach of offense and defense, much like in the Hunger Games themselves.</p>
